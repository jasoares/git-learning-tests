= Git Learning Tests

== Tests to learn the ins and outs of the Git Distributed Version Control System

I'll use this repository to make tests with git, branch merging, remote tracking, staging and unstaging files,
revert commits, rewrite history, etc.

Test descriptions will be provided later

Notes on learning:
  Git aliases
  Git core editor
  Git diff tool
  Git mergetool
